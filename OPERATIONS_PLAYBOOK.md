Most companies in [industry] manually transfer data between these, which typically costs 4-5 hours/week.

I help [industry] companies automate this using Make.com. My last client saved £3,000/month in manual data entry.

Jason

## Final Notes

### Success Principles

**1. Under-promise, Over-deliver**
- Add 25% buffer to all timelines
- Deliver features they didn't ask for (within reason)
- Be responsive (faster than expected)

**2. Communicate Proactively**
- Update clients before they ask
- Send progress videos
- Explain technical stuff simply

**3. Focus on ROI**
- Always tie automation to time/money saved
- Speak in business terms, not technical jargon
- Show clear before/after

**4. Build Trust**
- Be honest about what's possible
- Say "no" to bad-fit projects
- Admit mistakes quickly and fix them

**5. Think Long-term**
- Happy clients refer more clients
- Monthly maintenance = predictable income
- One good client can lead to 5 more

### Red Flags to Avoid

**Bad Clients:**
- "Can you just quickly..." (never quick)
- Unrealistic timelines demanded
- Unwilling to pay 50% upfront
- Poor communication during sales
- "My last developer..."

**Bad Projects:**
- Scope too vague
- No clear ROI
- Tools don't integrate well
